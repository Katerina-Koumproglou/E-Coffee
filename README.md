# Online Website for a Coffee Shop

This is my first full-stack e-commerce website built with **Vue.js** on the frontend, **ASP .NET Core (C#)** on the backend and a **PostgreSQL** database for a group university project.
It has a couple of different features such as it lets users browse the available products, register/login with their account as well as manage own their cart.
Try it for yourselves here :) [Website Link](http://ecoffee.dns.army/)
